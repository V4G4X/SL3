            <p>Four years ago, young Mannu, a wiry fellow with an intense love for Pizza decided to cut himself loose
                and
                set foot out of Kothrud,Pune. Well, he now makes pizza for a living, creating stories. He travels the
                globe in search of local flavours & amp ingredients for his cheese and generally lives life to the
                fullest.
                We bring to you Mannu and his experiments to create incredible cheese bases through Mama Cha Pizza.</p>
            <h3>We bring to you Luca and his experiments to create Incredible Cheese bases through Oven Story.</h3>
            </br>

            <h4>Chipotle Cheese</h4>
            <p>In 2015, when Luca was travelling to Mexico, extremely low on cash and in dire need of employment to be
                able to follow his calling to make the best Pizzas, Mr. Alejandro took him in. One evening, while Luca
                was preparing a meal for Mr. Alenjandro’s family & guests, he added crushed dried chipotle chillies to
                the cheese before spreading it on the pizza base. And Voila, Chipotle cheese was born.</p>

            </br>
            <h4>El Classico Cheese</h4>
            <p>Back in Positano, the locals loved smoked Mozzarella. It was a must have in every dish and was a common
                but respected ingredient in every household. Taking inspiration, Luca decided to keep one of his cheese
                classic and that my friend how El Classico Cheese was born</p>

            </br>
            <h4>Peri Peri Cheese</h4>
            <p>Peri Peri (Portugal)
                While visiting Africa, Luca came across the most popular African Bird-Eye chilly and was inspired to
                re-create the popular Portuguese Peri Peri. Originally from Portugal, Peri peri as flavor is quite
                renowned and adding it to cheese gave it a different twist.</p>

            </br>
            <h4>Tandoori Cheese</h4>
            <p>A bit of nutmeg, 2-3 cloves, a pinch of carom seeds, a stick of cinnamon, half a bulb garlic and some 10
                odd dried condiments or ‘garam masala’ finely ground with ½ a cup of water is how Luca started off.
                Playing with some condiments, Luca was trying to create a local favorite flavor – Tandoori. He specially
                visited India to take a crack on this flavor and add it to his cheese.</p>
